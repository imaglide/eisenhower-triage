Dear IT Team,

This is an urgent request for server maintenance that needs to be completed tonight. The production server is experiencing intermittent issues and requires immediate attention to prevent potential downtime.

Please schedule a maintenance window for tonight between 10 PM and 2 AM to address the following issues:
1. Database connection pool optimization
2. Memory leak investigation
3. Security patch deployment

This is critical for maintaining service availability and cannot be delayed.

Best regards,
System Administrator
