## Infrastructure Status

### Supabase Setup
- [ ] Project created
- [ ] Database schema designed
- [ ] API keys configured
- [ ] Tables created:
  - [ ] `emails_raw`
  - [ ] `triage_results`
  - [ ] `sender_profiles`

### Development Environment
- [ ] Python virtual environment
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] IDE/editor setup

## Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1 Priorities
1. **Set up development environment**
   - Create virtual environment
   - Install core dependencies
   - Configure environment variables

2. **Initialize Supabase project**
   - Create new Supabase project
   - Set up database schema
   - Configure API access

3. **Create core backend files**
   - `backend/config.py` - Configuration management
   - `backend/email_parser.py` - Basic .eml parsing
   - `backend/supabase_client.py` - Database connection

### Week 2 Priorities
1. **Implement email parser**
   - Parse .eml files to JSON
   - Handle encoding and validation
   - Add batch processing support

2. **Create triage engine foundation**
   - Basic email-only classification
   - Heuristic rules implementation
   - Confidence scoring

3. **Set up testing framework**
   - Unit tests for email parser
   - Integration tests for Supabase
   - Sample .eml files for testing

## Blockers & Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Supabase Account**: Need to create and configure
- **OpenAI API Key**: For embeddings (optional for initial version)
- **Sample .eml Files**: For testing and development

### Technical Dependencies
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for async/await support
- **Streamlit**: For UI development
- **Supabase Python Client**: For database operations
- **Email Library**: For .eml parsing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Supabase Integration**: Complex database operations and embedding storage
- **Email Parsing**: Handling various .eml formats and encodings

### Medium Risk
- **Classification Accuracy**: Ensuring reliable quadrant assignment
- **Performance**: Batch processing large numbers of emails

### Low Risk
- **UI Development**: Streamlit is well-documented and straightforward
- **Testing**: Standard Python testing practices apply

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success (Week 2)
- [ ] Can parse .eml files to JSON
- [ ] Can connect to Supabase and store data
- [ ] Basic email-only classification working
- [ ] Unit tests passing

### Phase 2 Success (Week 4)
- [ ] Batch processing pipeline complete
- [ ] Dual classification (email + context) working
- [ ] Database operations optimized
- [ ] Integration tests passing

### Phase 3 Success (Week 6)
- [ ] Streamlit UI functional
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison working
- [ ] Context viewer implemented
- [ ] End-to-end testing complete

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Dual Classification**: Separate email-only and contextual approaches for transparency
- **Batch First**: Prioritize batch processing over real-time UI for initial development
- **Supabase**: Chosen for vector storage and real-time capabilities

### Technical Decisions
- **Streamlit**: Selected for rapid UI development
- **JSON Output**: Flexible format for batch processing results
- **Async Operations**: For better performance with database operations

### Future Considerations
- **Microservices**: May split into separate services as project grows
- **Queue System**: For handling large batch jobs
- **Caching**: For frequently accessed sender profiles
